## Use cases
1. In your teams, think of some use cases of zero knowledge proofs What problems are there when using zkps in real world situations, such as providing an identity application for use in airports.


## Maths Introduction
1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. What is?
    
    a) (4 + 5) mod 8 = 1

    b) (3 x 5) mod 8 = 7 
2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

    a) Can we consider 'S' and the operation multiplication to be a group ?

    Yes, because has this certain properties:
    
        - Closure: For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a • b, is also in G.
        - Associativity: For all a, b and c in G, (a • b) • c = a • (b • c).
        - Identity element: There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a in G, 
        the equation e • a = a • e = a holds. Such an element is unique and thus one speaks of the 
        identity element.
        - Inverse element: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G, commonly denoted (or 
        −a, if the operation is denoted "+"), such that a • b = b • a = e, where e is the identity 
        element. 

    b) Can we consider 'S' and the operation division to be a group ?
    
    No, because hasn't this certain properties.

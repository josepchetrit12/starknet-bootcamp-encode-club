2. What do you understand by:

    The O notation  describes the time or space required to solve a problem in the worse case in terms of the size of the input.

    - O(n): The algorithmic complexity depends in the input size. The time taken to solve the problem goes lineal.
    - O(1): The algorithmic complexity its constant not depends in the input size. The time taken to solve the problem always is the same.
    - O(log n): The algorithmic complexity depends on the logarithm of the size of the input. The time taken to solve the problem goes logartihmic. This is better than the first one.

3. Which of those is best when describing a proof size?

    The second one because it not depeneds on the input size.

4. In your teams discuss why are there few identity projects on Starknet?

    Perhaps one of the reasons could be that the Starknet ecosystem is very new, and another thing I'm thinking as Starknet is a layer 2 created through zero knowledge, maybe they could directly give this utility thanks to account abstraction.
